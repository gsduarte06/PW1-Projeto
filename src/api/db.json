Your right brain excels at imagination, intuition, art, rhythm, feelings, and dreams. Meanwhile, the left brain is more analytical and focused on logic, sequencing, linear thinking, and mathematics. Like a human brain, generative AI excels at certain tasks, especially those related to right-brain creative activities. However, the absence of relevant and up-to-date information produces confusing hallucinations that are not grounded in reality. This presentation will explore how knowledge graphs built with factual and updated information can complement LLMs via retrieval augment generation (RAG) to produce more reliable results."

Traditional on-premises data analytics approaches can’t handle these data volumes because they don’t scale well enough and are too expensive. At the same time, data can be analysed to gain competitive insights, to support decision making and to train AI applications. In this workshop led by an AWS Solution Architect, participants will learn about data architecture fundamentals and get deep hands-on experience with building an enterprise-grade data lake with a business intelligence frontend on AWS, using AWS analytics services such as Glue, Athena, Lake Formation, Kinesis and QuickSight. Participants should have hands-on experience with AWS and bring an own laptop with AWS CLI installed. Sandbox AWS accounts for running workshop labs will be provided."

All of the live demo is coded by hand, and split up in very digestible pieces so it is easy to follow."

              "description": "Nowadays, everybody realizes the importance of preventing undue access to one's applications. Many conceptual models are available: RBAC, ABAC, you name it. Likewise, all popular stacks have frameworks and libraries to help developers implement your chosen policy access. If your organization only has a handful of apps, that's all fine and dandy, but problems appear at scale. One such problem is keeping under control access configuration across dozens or even hundreds of apps. It requires regular, if not continuous, auditing: it's impossible to achieve when the configuration is code, even worse if it's a compiled language. Open Policy Agent aims to externalize such configuration in a text format with specified semantics. In this presentation, I'll explain OPA in more detail and demo how to migrate from a regular Spring Boot application to an OPA-based approach in different steps."

Even though you are using continuous integration and delivery, you might wonder every time you release a new version to production if it will work or there will be some breakage on the latest version, eventually making production unavailable to the customers. Progressive delivery is the next step after Continuous Delivery to test your application in production before it becomes fully available to all your user bases. Embrace progressive delivery with techniques like the blue-green, canary release, shadowing traffic, or dark launches to validate the application in production using Kubernetes and tools like Istio, Prometheus, ArgoCD, or Argo Rollouts. Come to this session to learn progressive delivery in action using Kubernetes."

For those who haven't moved to GraalVM yet though, the questions and concerns are usually similar: how hard is to migrate? Can I use libraries and tools? Can I monitor such native applications? What about using latest Java features? In this hands-on session we'll talk about all the practical aspects of building and running applications with GraalVM, tooling, monitoring, using popular libraries, and cover common questions that we get from users."

Not ideal for real-world applications. In this talk, we’ll provide a quick overview of the latest advancements in multi-modal LLMs, highlighting their capabilities and limitations. We’ll then explore various techniques to overcome common LLM pitfalls, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance prompts with relevant data, ReACT prompting to guide LLMs in verbalizing their reasoning, Function Calling to grant LLMs access to external APIs, and Grounding to link LLM outputs to verifiable information sources, and more."

These AI developer tools are growing in popularity, as development teams experiment how they can use these tools to produce code faster and with fewer defects. Like all new tools, you need to understand how they work in order to optimise what you can get out of them. In this hands on workshop, we are going to use these tools to build an application from scratch. I will be using Python, so ideally you will have a good working knowledge of Python to get the best out of this session. You will need to bring your laptop and be running VSCode or Intellij."

Following the publication of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, teams have abandoned UML, discarded the concept of modelling and instead place a heavy reliance on conversations centered around incoherent whiteboard diagrams or shallow “Marketecture” diagrams created with Visio. Moving fast and being Agile requires good communication, yet software development teams struggle with this fundamental skill. A good set of software architecture diagrams are priceless for aligning a team around a shared vision and for getting new-joiners productive fast. This session explores the visual communication of software architecture and is based upon a decade of Simon's experiences working with software development teams large and small across the globe. He'll look at what is commonplace today, the importance of creating a shared vocabulary, diagram notation, and the value of creating a lightweight model to describe your software system using the “C4 model”, which he created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase."

Secrets can include API keys, credentials, tokens, certificates, and passwords that grant access to various resources and systems. If these secrets are compromised, attackers can exploit them to cause damage, steal information, or disrupt operations. The challenges of secret management is how to securely store, distribute, and rotate secrets in a dynamic and distributed environment. Traditional methods of hard-coding secrets in configuration files or environment variables are not secure, scalable, or reliable. Moreover, secrets need to be updated frequently to comply with security policies and regulations to prevent unauthorized access. To address these challenges, several tools and frameworks have been developed to provide secret management solutions for DevOps. These tools can help DevOps teams to implement best practices for secret management."

Their products and software have aged and become hard to maintain until they reach Technical Death, where all available effort goes into mere survival. At the same time, in our global economy, competition comes from anywhere, with better products built at lower costs. Organizations must jump the Innovators’ Dilemma and reinvent themselves to stay ahead of the competition. Speed, agility, and adaptability are more crucial than ever. However, agile frameworks became both a solution and a source of uncertainty and rigidity. Organizations seek fresh perspectives and adaptable strategies and techniques. They are stuck. This talk presents a battle-tested repertoire of practical strategies and techniques that serve as a compass for comprehending and continuously navigating between maintenance, renovation, and innovation, maintaining a solid focus on customer-centricity, reaching your dot on the horizon while instilling transparency, autonomy, and collaboration. These strategies involve leveraging proposed tools such as idea funnels, tech boards, collectives, and microteams. This talk empowers you to evolve from conventional agile and cultivate a culture of continuous growth. Of course, it offers a treasure trove of real-life stories from the trenches, providing an authentic glimpse into agile but redefined for the modern era. This talk will help your organization to get unstuck."
